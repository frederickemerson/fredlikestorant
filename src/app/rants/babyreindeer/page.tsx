          You know, when I first started watching Baby Reindeer, I thought it was just going to be another show about some creepy stalker terrorizing a guy. But man, was I wrong. This series goes way deeper than that. It's like peeling back layers of an onion, each episode revealing a new facet of the human experience. As the series unfolds, we see Donny's internal struggle laid bare. It's like he's wrestling with these demons inside him, trying to find some kind of meaning or purpose in all the chaos. And Martha, she's like this dark mirror reflecting back all his fears and insecurities.<br/><br/>

From the get-go, we're introduced to Donny, this guy with big dreams but an even bigger sense of insecurity. He's chasing something, you can tell, but it's like he's running in circles, trying to prove himself to the world. And then Martha comes along, stirring up this whirlwind of emotions in him. It's like she's feeding his ego, giving him the validation he craves. In Donnys' pursuit of his dreams, while also searching for some kind of connection in a world that feels so cold and indifferent, Martha gradually becomes his addiction. We could take a small curve and talk about the fact how everyone deep down craves some form of attention, a reason to live in this world. As a child, I always wondered why we crave validation, but growing up i realised that's one of the things that make us human. We are social beings and we are wired to feel emotions, even though some people are claimed to be "emotionless" doesn't mean they don't have any, its more about the fact that the degree they value those impulses are quite weak. Back to the storyline, by episode 5 i had formed a clearer image of donny. A weak man with big dreams, but as we all know dreams comes with sacrifices and later at the end of episode 6 he talks about how he didn't want to be judged but yet wanted fame. In my opinion, they go hand in hand and a career as a standup comedian calls for lot of exposure to the public, so when one of his reasons was to hide his Youtube videos it showed how low his self-esteem(the reason to his low self-esteem is clearly depicted in the flashback in episode 4, his transition from a cheerful strong willed person to a weak willed person). <br/><br/>

Another reason why i consider Donny to be weak is the fact that he let himself groomed, he knew he wasn't making the right decision and at that point in time he let himself be prostituted for this dreams. That brings us to the question, What is the true worth of our dreams ?  and people arguing that it was not his fault, that it was the situation are clearly wrong and making excuses for him. Donny didn't mind being groomed because he thought he could easily succeed with Darien's help. Thinking about it, most of us are pretty weak as well without realising that letting other people build your dreams also comes with the risk of trusting they won't topple it down. We’d like to think we’re strong, we’re smart, and we’d do the perfect thing, but the reality is that if someone can find the right buttons to press to get whatever it is they want, we’d almost all fold like a house of cards. Darien also signifies success, and when someone successful compliments you, its natural to feel good about yourself and fuel your own ego. Donny felt so happy with Darien's compliment that he completely gave himself to him, even to the point where he doesn't trust rationality( Keeley's questioning). Going off curve again, as audience we are shown what would happen if a man was sexually assaulted. It's sad honestly and the fact that he didn’t leave Darrien’s house right after the assault but instead stayed for days after, playing with his cat. "Is my self-respect so low?" he asks, "Is my lust for success so high?" ( episode 6 ending, he comes to terms with the fact that his decision wasn't right) <br/><br/>

It's not the usual Hollywood portrayal where the tough guy just brushes it off. He's grappling with all these feelings of shame and confusion. You can see him struggling with this idea that, as a man, he's supposed to be tough and in control, but here he is, feeling completely vulnerable and powerless. And then there's this whole thing about masculinity. Donny's assault really messes with his sense of manhood. He's questioning everything about himself, his identity, his worth. It's like society has these expectations of what it means to be a man, and when something like this happens, it just shatters all those ideas. But what really hits home is how Donny blames himself. He's wrestling with all this guilt and self-doubt, wondering if he could have done something differently. It's heartbreaking to see him go through all that, especially when you know he's not alone in feeling that way. What I find really powerful about Baby Reindeer is how it brings all these issues to light. It's not just about the assault itself, but also about the aftermath, the emotional toll it takes. And by focusing on a male survivor, it challenges those stereotypes and reminds us that sexual assault can happen to anyone. It's a raw and honest portrayal that really gets you thinking. <br/><br/>

To add onto loneliness, Donny's continued obsession with Martha, even after she stopped emailing him and was eventually arrested, speaks volumes about the depth of his loneliness and inner turmoil. Despite knowing the toxicity of his relationship with Martha, he remains tethered to her through his actions and thoughts. In Episode 6, Donny admits to listening to Martha's voicemails like a podcast, almost obsessively, finding a strange sort of comfort in her messages despite their threatening and hateful content. He even goes as far as categorizing and analyzing the emotions behind each voicemail, demonstrating his fixation on her and the impact she has on his psyche. This is evidenced in his statement: "From then on out, the voice-mails became the soundtrack to his life". Moreover, Donny's admission that he masturbates over Martha's picture highlights the extent to which his fantasies and desires are intertwined with his trauma and self-hatred. Despite being in a supposedly stable and loving relationship with Teri, his inability to fully connect with her on an emotional level is revealed through his continued preoccupation with Martha. This is reflected in his confession: "I’d go home, I’d masturbate over her picture, I’d think of her when I was having sex with Teri, even though I loved Teri". <br/><br/>

Episode 6 and 7 of Baby Reindeer really pull back the curtain on Donny's inner struggles. It's like he's been carrying this heavy burden for so long, and finally, he finds the courage to let it all out. When he talks about his problems, you can almost feel the weight lifting off his shoulders. It's a powerful reminder of the importance of opening up and facing our demons head-on. Take that moment in Episode 7 when Donny confesses to his parents about his sexuality. His father's response, "Would you think low of me as a man," is heartwarming. But despite the challenges, Donny is brave. He stares his fears right in the face and refuses to back down. It's like he's finally found his voice, his truth, and he's not afraid to share it with the world. That open confession in front of everyone? It's like he's saying, "This is me, take it or leave it," and there's something incredibly liberating about that. That confession, takes up a lot of courage to say it out of loud and that too in a room full of 100 random strangers, sets fire to everything he's hidden away. It's painful, but i feel it's also a necessary step towards finding freedom from his demons. A quick take on Martha, i personally fell that the breadth of her obsession is a bit much, of course, but the last moment when Donny listens to here voicemail about her little reindeer reminds Donny and us of the fact that  we don’t actually know any of Martha’s backstory beyond that initial stalking conviction. There could be a possibility that someone made her how she is, too, and if we sympathise with Donny, we have no choice but to sympathise with her. This doesn't mean that Martha isn't at fault, quite clearly she is but there has to be a reason for everything and hating Martha just because of her obsession without having a complete knowledge of her past is idiotic.<br/><br/>

When I first heard about Baby Reindeer, it sounded like your typical true-crime tale—a wild woman stalking a barman. But as the series unfolded, it took a surprising turn. Instead of just focusing on Martha's obsession, it became clear that the story was really about Donny and his inner battles. You could almost feel Donny's struggle to find himself amidst the chaos. There was this pivotal moment where he realized his journey wasn't just about fame or validation—it was about understanding who he really was. And that's something we can all relate to, right? Trying to make sense of our own identities in a world that's constantly judging us. I think what really struck me was how Donny's story forced us to confront our own insecurities and vulnerabilities. We saw him grapple with his flaws and trauma, and it was like looking in a mirror. It made me realize that we're all just trying to find our place in the world, no matter how messy or painful it gets. <br/><br/>

In the end, Baby Reindeer wasn't just a true-crime drama. It was a deeply human story about resilience, self-discovery, and the messy journey of life. And that's what made it so compelling.
